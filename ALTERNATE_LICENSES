TooManyOrigins' networking related code is loosely based on the Botania codebase's networking code.
There are a few changes from Botania's networking code.
- Handlers are done through unique interfaces that extend the Packet interface as opposed to a static method.
- Some methods and parameters have been renamed.

Botania was created by Vazkii.

- External Clause
  Certain parts of the codebase are indicated to be licensed under alternative licenses. You
  must obey those licenses.
- Attribution Clause
  You must give appropriate credit to Vazkii as the creator of Botania or the parts of it
  you're using. If you do any alterations the fact that you do so should also be
  indicated. A link back is optional but it would be cool if you would do so.
- Copyleft Clause
  Your project must be open source (have its source visible and allow for redistribution
  and modification) and include a clause similar to this one in its license.
- API Clause
  Any of the other clauses under this section do not apply to any Botania API
  code (the subdirectory src/main/java/vazkii/botania/api). However, if Botania API code
  is used, it must be included verbatim as it was obtained.
